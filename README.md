"# react_youtube_api" 
Following the React-Redux tutorial by Stephen Grider, I have built a Youtube Player in ReactJS.

The document  "Step by step - Youtube Player in ReactJS" provides a step-by-step explanation of how to create the App. To follow through the instruction easily, code snips and snips of localhost UI are provided. You will also find some theory, for example:

Difference between functional and class based component 
Use of an arrow function
Definition and use  of State 
Definition and use of Controlled Field
Use of Downwards data flow
Use of Props
Definition and use of Key 
Handling Null Process
Use of callback
